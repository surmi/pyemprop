# pyemprop
Python scripts for electromagnetic wave propagation.

Current implementation contains only FFT-based scalar propagation based on Sypek, M. Light propagation in the Fresnel region. New numerical approach. Optics Communications 116, 43â€“48 (1995)

# TODO
- Didactic exmaples of propagation to demonstrate EM wave diffraction phenomenon e.g. Talbot effect, Arago spot (also called Poisson spot or Fresnel spot), Fresnel zones, hologram with GS algorithm, or just scalar propagation applications, lens (on-axis vs off-axis equations), Gaussian beam propagation.
- Different optimization alogrithms for diffractive structures.
- Add GPU support.
